          <h1>History and Collections</h1>
          <img src="beach.png" style="padding: 30px; float: left" alt="Sylvia Beach">
          <p>This famous independent bookstore was founded by American Sylvia Beach in November 1919 in Paris, France. In 1941, the bookstore was closed forever in it's original location after the Nazis returned to the shop to take Ms. Beach to jail after she refused to sell them a book. Another bookstore was re-named Shakespeare and Company in her honor in 1964 on the 400th Anniversary of William Shakespeare's birth. People come from all over the world to experience the atmosphere and take a step back in time.

            <p>A professor at the University of Paris and the founder (along with her husband) of the Curie Institute, Madame Curie won two Nobel Peace prizes for her pioneering research in radiation. Because of this work, she was able to add two new elements to the periodic table. </p>

            <ul>
              <li><i>I was taught that the way of progress was neither swift nor easy.</i></li>
              <li><i>In science, we must be interested in things, not in persons.</i></li>
